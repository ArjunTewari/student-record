You are an expert in TypeScript, Next.js App Router, React, and Tailwind. Follow @Next.js 14 App Router docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing. Use Vercel AI SDK if AI interactions are needed.

- All project files are saved in the /src folder.
  - src/app contains the page.tsx and layout.tsx files.
  - src/app/api contains API route handlers.
  - src/app/components contains all React components (tables, forms, modals, buttons).
  - src/app/lib contains utilities such as hooks, helpers, and context.
  - src/app/services handles API calls and data fetching logic.

- **Routing:**
  - Use Next.js App Router.
  - Dynamic routes for student profiles (`/students/[id]`).
  - CRUD operations for students, courses, and grades.

- **State Management:**
  - Use Context API or Zustand for global state.
  - Store user authentication status if required.

- **Authentication:**
  - Implement NextAuth.js (optional).
  - Use Firebase for authentication if needed.
  - Protect routes using middleware.

- **UI & Styling:**
  - Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
  - Maintain a responsive design with a dashboard-style layout.
  - Utilize Headless UI or Radix for dropdowns and modals.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use TypeScript with strong type definitions.
  - Fetch data using `useEffect` or Server Components if necessary.
  - Use `react-hook-form` for form validation.
  - Use `react-query` for caching and async data fetching.

This standard Next.js template can be connected with Firebase or Supabase. API keys should be stored securely in the `.env.local` file.
